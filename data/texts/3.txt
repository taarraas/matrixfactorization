The space shuttle Enterprise’s scheduled arrival in New York City has been pushed back because of possible bad weather.

Nasa said Monday’s planned arrival of the shuttle has been postponed “until further notice”.

The Enterprise is being brought to the city where it has a new permanent home waiting at the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum.

Nasa managers are monitoring weather forecasts and will reschedule the shuttle’s flight as soon as possible.

The plan is to fly the shuttle on top of a carrier aircraft to New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport.

It will be moved by barge to the Intrepid museum for public display.

The museum is at a decommissioned aircraft carrier moored off Manhattan. It has been making room for the shuttle on its flight deck.
