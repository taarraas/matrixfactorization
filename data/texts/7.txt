Roger Charlton’s Dubai hero Cityscape has been given the green light to run in the BMW Champions Mile in Hong Kong on May 6.

The six-year-old ran out a brilliant winner of the Dubai Duty Free on World Cup night at Meydan under James Doyle and after discussing options with owner Khalid Abdullah, Charlton has revealed his charge will soon be on his travels again.

“Cityscape has been given the go-ahead to travel to Hong Kong next Friday to run in the BMW Champions Mile with James Doyle,” the trainer told his website www.rogercharlton.com.

“He seems to be in great form. It is a demanding schedule, but luckily he has developed into a relaxed traveller and seems to enjoy clocking up his air miles.”

It promises to be a huge weekend for the Beckhampton trainer, with the highly-touted Top Offer set to run in the Qipco 2000 Guineas at Newmarket a day earlier.
