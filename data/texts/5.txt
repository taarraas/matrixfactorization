A powerful earthquake hit waters off eastern Indonesia today, sending panicked residents running from their homes, offices and schools. There was some damage, but no immediate reports of injuries.

The US Geological Survey said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.6 and hit 50 miles off Papua province.

It was centred just 18 miles beneath the ocean floor.

Children in the town of Manokwan, closest to the epicentre, were seen running from their schools screaming. Streets also filled with those escaping shaking buildings.

“I ran out of my house with my kids as soon as I felt the tremors,” said Pinta Uli, a mother of two, adding that they saw one street lamp topple to the ground.

The wall in front of a government office also collapsed.
