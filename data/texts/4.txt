Two bomb blasts killed four people in north-western Baghdad, two days after a series of attacks claimed the lives of 30 in the capital and across the country, Iraqi officials said today.

Police said that the first bomb exploded inside a minibus in the Shiite neighbourhood of Ishkouk. Seconds later, a roadside bomb exploded a few yards away, hitting another civilian car.

A medic at the nearby al-Nour hospital said that four people including a woman were killed and 13 others were wounded in the two blasts.

Violence has ebbed nationwide in recent years, but militants still launch deadly attacks around the country.
